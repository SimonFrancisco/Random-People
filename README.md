This is an app that gets that data from https://randomuser.me/ and parses them through Retrofit and Mosh. I use Glide to get the images and fragments for my navigation and databinding 
for binding fragments and be able to pass data to fragments in XML. I make use of ViewModels and Safeargs to get that across fragments and to surive configuration changes!
